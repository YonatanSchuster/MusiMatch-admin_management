***This app is part of my final project in my academic studies.*** <br />
My final project is an Android app that connects between  poetry/poem writers
to musicians and composers so that they can turn their ideas into reality and even produce them into real songs.<br />
This specific project is a dashboard for the admin of the application where he can see different data directly from the database.<br />
To create the project I used React and Node and some external libraries to build tables and graphs
